# YouTube-Music-Playlist

This extension will make it easier to listen to your music on YouTube. 

If you're like me, you subscribe to channels on YouTube that exclusively post music. Channels like Trap Nation, House Nation, and NoCopyrightSounds. Personally, I add all these videos to the "watch later" playlist so that I can listen to them in a session while I work. This is so that I don't have to keep clicking on a video every time I want to listen to it and interrupt my work. The extension would automatically go through my YouTube subscription feed and add all the music videos to the watch later playlist.

With my extension, you could just click a button and it would add all the music videos (in the past month lets say) in your sub feed to the watch later playlist. This would be like 150-200 videos. Then, you can go to the playlist and just play em all. It requires 3 clicks with the extension to watch all of those videos compared to 200+ to watch every video individually or click to add them to a playlist manually.
